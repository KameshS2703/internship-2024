    "### Q1: Difference Between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label Encoding\n",
    "Assigns a unique integer to each category of a categorical variable. It is suitable when the categorical variable is nominal, meaning there is no inherent order among the categories. For example, the color categories `red`, `green`, and `blue` might be encoded as `0`, `1`, and `2`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "Used when there is a natural ordering among categories. It assigns integers to categories based on their order. For instance, if we have a categorical variable `Education Level` with the values `High School`, `Bachelor's`, `Master's`, and `PhD`, an ordinal encoding might assign `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` to these levels, respectively, reflecting their increasing educational attainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "- Use **Label Encoding** for nominal categories where the order does not matter.\n",
    "- Use **Ordinal Encoding** for ordinal categories where the order is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "A technique where categories are encoded based on their relationship with the target variable. Categories are sorted according to their mean target value and assigned an ordinal integer based on this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine a dataset where we predict housing prices (`Price`) based on `Neighborhood` (categories: A, B, C, D). We calculate the mean price for each neighborhood and encode the neighborhoods according to these mean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate mean price for each neighborhood:\n",
    "   - Neighborhood A: $200,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood B: $150,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood C: $180,000\n",
    "   - Neighborhood D: $220,000\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encode based on sorted mean prices:\n",
    "   - Neighborhood B: 0\n",
    "   - Neighborhood C: 1\n",
    "   - Neighborhood A: 2\n",
    "   - Neighborhood D: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance\n",
    "A measure of how much two random variables change together. If the variables tend to increase and decrease together, the covariance is positive; if one tends to increase while the other decreases, the covariance is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance in Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "- Covariance helps to understand the relationship between two variables and whether they move in the same direction or not.\n",
    "- It is a key component in calculating correlation and in multivariate statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation:\n",
    "For variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), with means \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X}) (Y_i - \\bar{Y}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( n \\) is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Label Encoding Using Python's scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the categorical variables\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'green', 'blue'],\n",
    "    'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large', 'small', 'medium'],\n",
    "    'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic', 'wood', 'plastic']\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a DataFrame\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize LabelEncoder\n",
    "label_encoders = {}\n",
    "for column in df.columns:\n",
    "    le = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "    df[column] = le.fit_transform(df[column])\n",
    "    label_encoders[column] = le\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Color  Size  Material\n",
    "0      2     2         1\n",
    "1      1     1         0\n",
    "2      0     0         2\n",
    "3      1     2         1\n",
    "4      0     1         2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the output, each category is replaced with a unique integer. For example, `red` is encoded as `2`, `green` as `1`, and `blue` as `0` for the `Color` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Covariance Matrix Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "data = np.array([\n",
    "    [25, 50000, 2],\n",
    "    [30, 60000, 3],\n",
    "    [35, 55000, 2],\n",
    "    [40, 65000, 4],\n",
    "    [45, 70000, 3]\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculate the covariance matrix\n",
    "cov_matrix = np.cov(data, rowvar=False)\n",
    "print(cov_matrix)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- The covariance matrix will show how much each pair of variables changes together.\n",
    "- Diagonal elements represent the variance of each variable.\n",
    "- Off-diagonal elements represent the covariance between pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Encoding Methods for Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender (Male/Female):\n",
    "Use **Label Encoding** or **Binary Encoding**. The binary encoding can be useful for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Education Level (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD):\n",
    "Use **Ordinal Encoding** since there's a natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Employment Status (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time):\n",
    "Use **One-Hot Encoding**. It avoids any misleading ordinal relationships and works well with many machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Covariance Between Continuous and Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation:\n",
    "To calculate covariance, you generally need numeric values for all variables. Convert categorical variables to numerical values first (e.g., via one-hot encoding) before calculating covariance. For direct covariance calculations between continuous and categorical variables, you might need to use specific techniques or additional statistical methods like ANOVA or correlation analysis.\n",
