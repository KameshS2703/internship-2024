    "### Q1: What is Lasso Regression, and How Does it Differ from Other Regression Techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
    "- **Definition**: Lasso regression is a type of regularized regression that adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 norm).\n",
    "- **Equation**:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Cost Function} = \\text{RSS} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - \\(\\text{RSS}\\) is the residual sum of squares.\n",
    "  - \\(\\lambda\\) is the regularization parameter.\n",
    "  - \\(\\beta_j\\) are the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Other Techniques**:\n",
    "- **OLS Regression**: Does not include any regularization term, leading to potential overfitting if there are many predictors.\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression**: Uses L2 regularization (squared coefficients penalty), which shrinks coefficients but does not set them exactly to zero.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression**: Uses L1 regularization (absolute value of coefficients), which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Main Advantage of Using Lasso Regression in Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**:\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**: Lasso regression performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, which helps in identifying and retaining only the most important features.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Results in a simpler and more interpretable model with fewer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Interpreting the Coefficients of a Lasso Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficients**:\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Coefficients represent the change in the response variable for a one-unit change in the predictor, with the effect of regularization.\n",
    "- **Shrinkage**: Coefficients that are shrunk to zero indicate that the corresponding features are less important or irrelevant. Non-zero coefficients indicate significant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Tuning Parameter**:\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\))**:\n",
    "  - **Effect**: Controls the amount of regularization applied. Higher values of \\(\\lambda\\) increase the penalty, leading to more coefficients being driven to zero.\n",
    "  - **Selection**: Must be chosen carefully to balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Considerations**:\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Typically used to find the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) that minimizes the model's prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Lasso Regression for Non-linear Regression Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-linear Regression**:\n",
    "- **Direct Use**: Lasso regression is inherently designed for linear relationships between predictors and the response variable.\n",
    "- **Extension**: For non-linear problems, you can apply Lasso regression after transforming the features (e.g., polynomial features) to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Difference Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge Regression**:\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Uses L2 norm penalty (\\(\\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\\)).\n",
    "- **Effect**: Shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero; all predictors remain in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression**:\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Uses L1 norm penalty (\\(\\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\\)).\n",
    "- **Effect**: Can shrink some coefficients to zero, performing feature selection and producing a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Lasso Regression and Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "- **Effectiveness**: Lasso regression can handle multicollinearity by reducing the coefficients of highly correlated predictors, often setting some to zero.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Helps stabilize the model and select a subset of predictors from a set of correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Choosing the Optimal Value of the Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) in Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**:\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation**: Perform k-fold cross-validation to find the \\(\\lambda\\) that results in the best model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**: Evaluate multiple values of \\(\\lambda\\) and select the one with the lowest cross-validation error.\n",
    "3. **Regularization Path Algorithms**: Use algorithms like LARS (Least Angle Regression) to compute solutions across a range of \\(\\lambda\\) values efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure**:\n",
    "- **Split Data**: Use training and validation sets.\n",
    "- **Train Models**: Fit Lasso models with different \\(\\lambda\\) values.\n",
    "- **Evaluate**: Choose the \\(\\lambda\\) that gives the best performance according to the validation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).\n",
