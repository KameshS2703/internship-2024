    "### Q1: Pearson Correlation Coefficient Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pearson Correlation Coefficient** measures the linear relationship between two variables. Here’s how to calculate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from scipy.stats import pearsonr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data: hours spent studying and exam scores\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:\n",
    "- A coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship.\n",
    "- A coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship.\n",
    "- A coefficient around 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",

    "- Spearman’s rank correlation also ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",
    "  - 1 indicates a perfect positive monotonic relationship.\n",
    "  - -1 indicates a perfect negative monotonic relationship.\n",
