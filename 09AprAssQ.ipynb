    "### Q1: What is Bayes' Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental principle in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event, given prior knowledge and new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What is the Formula for Bayes' Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability: the probability of event \\( A \\) given that \\( B \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood: the probability of event \\( B \\) given that \\( A \\) is true.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability: the probability of event \\( A \\) before observing \\( B \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the marginal probability: the total probability of event \\( B \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: How is Bayes' Theorem Used in Practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is used in various practical applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spam Filtering**: To classify emails as spam or not based on the presence of certain words.\n",
    "- **Medical Diagnosis**: To estimate the probability of a disease given test results.\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: In Bayesian inference for machine learning models to update predictions based on new data.\n",
    "- **Decision Making**: In areas like finance and risk management to update beliefs based on new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: What is the Relationship Between Bayes' Theorem and Conditional Probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is fundamentally based on the concept of conditional probability. It provides a method to compute the conditional probability of an event \\( A \\) given another event \\( B \\), using the reverse conditional probability \\( P(B|A) \\), along with the prior probabilities of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Bayes' theorem shows how to update the probability of a hypothesis (event \\( A \\)) as more evidence (event \\( B \\)) becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: How Do You Choose Which Type of Naive Bayes Classifier to Use for Any Given Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of Naive Bayes classifiers, each suitable for different types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Assumes that the features follow a normal distribution. Suitable for continuous data where the normality assumption holds.\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Assumes that features follow a multinomial distribution. Ideal for categorical data, such as word counts in text classification.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Assumes that features are binary (present or not present). Useful for binary or boolean features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the Naive Bayes classifier based on the nature of your data:\n",
    "- For continuous data with Gaussian distribution, use Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "- For categorical data or count-based features, use Multinomial Naive Bayes.\n",
    "- For binary features, use Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
