    "### Q1: What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees. The algorithm is designed to handle a variety of regression problems, leveraging the concept of bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: How Does Random Forest Regressor Reduce the Risk of Overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bagging**: By training multiple decision trees on different bootstrap samples of the training data, the model reduces variance. Each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, which helps to generalize better on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Randomization**: During the training of each tree, Random Forest selects a random subset of features for splitting at each node. This decorrelates the trees and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Averaging**: The final prediction is the average of predictions from all the trees in the forest. Averaging helps to smooth out the individual treeâ€™s predictions, reducing the effect of any single overfitted tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: How Does Random Forest Regressor Aggregate the Predictions of Multiple Decision Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Averaging**: For regression tasks, the predictions from all the individual decision trees are averaged to produce the final output. This average is taken across all the trees in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If you have 100 trees and each tree predicts a value of 10, 12, and 11, the Random Forest Regressor will compute the average of these predictions: \\( \\text{Final Prediction} = \\frac{10 + 12 + 11}{3} = 11 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: What Are the Hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key hyperparameters of a Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n_estimators`**: Number of decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "- **`max_depth`**: Maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "- **`min_samples_split`**: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "- **`min_samples_leaf`**: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "- **`max_features`**: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "- **`bootstrap`**: Whether to use bootstrap samples (default is `True`).\n",
    "- **`random_state`**: Seed for the random number generator (for reproducibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What Is the Difference Between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Regressor**:\n",
    "- **Single Tree**: Uses a single decision tree to make predictions.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: More prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Directly outputs the prediction based on the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Regressor**:\n",
    "- **Ensemble of Trees**: Uses multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the data.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Less prone to overfitting due to averaging and feature randomness.\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Outputs the average of predictions from all trees in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- **High Accuracy**: Often provides high predictive accuracy due to ensemble learning.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to outliers and noise in the data.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Can provide insights into feature importance.\n",
    "- **Handles Missing Values**: Can handle missing values better than some other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "- **Computationally Intensive**: Requires more memory and computation due to the large number of trees.\n",
    "- **Less Interpretability**: More complex and less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Slower Predictions**: Predictions can be slower compared to simpler models, especially with a large number of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: What Is the Output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value. It is the average of the predictions made by each decision tree in the forest for a given input. This aggregated prediction provides the final estimated value for the regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Can Random Forest Regressor Be Used for Classification Tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, **Random Forest Regressor** is specifically designed for regression tasks. For classification tasks, you would use a **Random Forest Classifier**. The Random Forest Classifier aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by majority voting to classify data into discrete classes."
