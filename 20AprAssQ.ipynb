    "### Q1: What is the KNN Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the `k` nearest data points to a given query point and making predictions based on these neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Classification**: The prediction is made based on the majority class among the `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "- **For Regression**: The prediction is made by averaging the values of the `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: How Do You Choose the Value of K in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the value of `k` is crucial for the performance of the KNN algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small K**: A small value of `k` (e.g., 1 or 3) makes the model sensitive to noise and may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Large K**: A large value of `k` smooths out the decision boundary and reduces variance but can lead to underfitting.\n",
    "- **Choosing K**: Use techniques like cross-validation to determine the optimal value of `k` that balances bias and variance. Typically, `k` is chosen to be an odd number to avoid ties in classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is the Difference Between KNN Classifier and KNN Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KNN Classifier**: Predicts the class label of a data point based on the majority class among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "- **KNN Regressor**: Predicts the value of a data point by averaging the values of its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- **KNN Classifier**: Predicting whether an email is spam or not based on its similarity to other emails.\n",
    "- **KNN Regressor**: Predicting the price of a house based on the prices of similar houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: How Do You Measure the Performance of KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Classification**:\n",
    "  - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.\n",
    "  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Metrics for evaluating the performance on imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "  - **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Regression**:\n",
    "  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  - **R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What is the Curse of Dimensionality in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curse of Dimensionality** refers to the challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance Metrics**: In high dimensions, distances between points become less informative as all points tend to be equidistant from each other.\n",
    "- **Sparsity**: The data becomes sparse in high dimensions, making it harder to find meaningful neighbors.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: High-dimensional data can lead to overfitting as the model becomes too sensitive to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: How Do You Handle Missing Values in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imputation**: Fill in missing values using statistical methods (mean, median) or predictive models before applying KNN.\n",
    "- **Use Only Complete Cases**: Exclude rows with missing values if they are few.\n",
    "- **Weighted KNN**: Some variants of KNN handle missing values by weighting the neighbors based on available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Compare and Contrast the Performance of KNN Classifier and Regressor\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KNN Classifier**:\n",
    "  - **Strengths**: Simple to understand and implement, effective for classification tasks with clear class boundaries.\n",
    "  - **Weaknesses**: Can be sensitive to noise, performs poorly with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **KNN Regressor**:\n",
    "  - **Strengths**: Simple and intuitive for regression tasks, does not assume a specific form for the relationship between features and target.\n",
    "  - **Weaknesses**: Can suffer from high variance and overfitting in the presence of noise or high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which to Use**:\n",
    "- **KNN Classifier**: Best for categorical outcomes where you want to classify data into distinct classes.\n",
    "- **KNN Regressor**: Best for predicting continuous values where the relationship between features and target is not easily defined by a parametric model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Strengths and Weaknesses of KNN and How to Address Them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**:\n",
    "- **Simple and Intuitive**: Easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "- **No Training Phase**: The model is lazy and performs computations only during prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses**:\n",
    "- **Computationally Expensive**: Requires storing all training data and computing distances during prediction.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Noise**: Can be affected by noisy data and irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Address Weaknesses**:\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features to ensure all features contribute equally.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features.\n",
    "- **Distance Metrics**: Experiment with different distance metrics to find the best fit for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9: What is the Difference Between Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It is calculated as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  d = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  It is the most common distance metric used in KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manhattan Distance**: Measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. It is calculated as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  d = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  It is useful when you want to measure distances in a grid-like path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10: What is the Role of Feature Scaling in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Scaling** is crucial in KNN because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation**: KNN relies on distance metrics, and features with different scales can disproportionately affect the distance calculation. For example, a feature with a large range will dominate the distance measure if not scaled properly.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation and improves the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Scaling Techniques**:\n",
    "- **Standardization**: Transform features to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Scale features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1]."
