    "### Q1: Key Features of the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features and Their Importance:\n",
    "1. **Fixed Acidity**: Measures the amount of acids that do not change with pH. It affects the taste and stability of the wine.\n",
    "2. **Volatile Acidity**: Measures the amount of acetic acid. High levels can lead to off-flavors, impacting quality negatively.\n",
    "3. **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness and flavor. Higher levels can enhance quality.\n",
    "4. **Residual Sugar**: Sweetness level. Affects taste and balance.\n",
    "5. **Chlorides**: Measures the amount of salt. High levels can indicate poor quality.\n",
    "6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Preservative to prevent oxidation and spoilage.\n",
    "7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Sum of free and bound sulfur dioxide.\n",
    "8. **Density**: Mass per unit volume. Affects the texture and body of the wine.\n",
    "9. **pH**: Measures acidity or alkalinity. Influences flavor and stability.\n",
    "10. **Sulphates**: Adds flavor and acts as a preservative.\n",
    "11. **Alcohol**: High alcohol content often correlates with better quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance:\n",
    "- **Fixed Acidity**: High fixed acidity might indicate a more balanced wine.\n",
    "- **Volatile Acidity**: High levels can negatively affect quality.\n",
    "- **Citric Acid**: Positive correlation with quality.\n",
    "- **Residual Sugar**: Balance between sweetness and acidity is important.\n",
    "- **Chlorides**: Excessive levels can affect taste.\n",
    "- **Free and Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Important for preservation and stability.\n",
    "- **Density**: Indicates the overall body and texture.\n",
    "- **pH**: Affects flavor and stability.\n",
    "- **Sulphates**: Contributes to flavor and preservation.\n",
    "- **Alcohol**: Higher alcohol content often enhances perceived quality.\n",

    "### Q2: Handling Missing Data in the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imputation Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Mean/Median Imputation**: Simple and effective for numerical data.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Easy to implement and understand.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: May not be suitable for data with a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mode Imputation**: Used for categorical data.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Preserves the mode of the data.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: May not capture underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Uses the nearest neighbors to estimate missing values.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Takes into account similarities between observations.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Imputation**: Creates several imputed datasets and combines the results.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Provides a range of possible values, reflecting uncertainty.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: More complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Key Factors Affecting Students' Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factors:\n",
    "1. **Study Time**: More study time generally correlates with better performance.\n",
    "2. **Attendance**: Regular attendance is usually associated with better grades.\n",
    "3. **Previous Academic Performance**: Past performance often predicts future performance.\n",
    "4. **Parental Involvement**: Support and involvement can positively impact performance.\n",
    "5. **Health and Well-being**: Physical and mental health affect cognitive abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Using Statistical Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Correlation Analysis**: To find relationships between study time, attendance, and performance.\n",
    "2. **Regression Analysis**: To predict performance based on factors like study time and attendance.\n",
    "3. **ANOVA**: To compare performance across different groups (e.g., different levels of parental involvement).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Feature Engineering in the Student Performance Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features such as study time, attendance, and previous grades.\n",
    "2. **Feature Transformation**:\n",
    "   - **Normalization/Standardization**: To bring features onto a common scale.\n",
    "   - **Binning**: Convert continuous variables (e.g., study time) into categorical bins.\n",
    "3. **Creation of Interaction Features**: Combine features (e.g., study time * attendance) to capture interactions.\n",
    "4. **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing data based on its nature and extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code for EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from scipy.stats import norm\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the wine quality dataset\n",
    "wine_data = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display summary statistics\n",
    "print(wine_data.describe())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot histograms\n",
    "wine_data.hist(figsize=(12, 10))\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check for normality\n",
    "for column in wine_data.columns:\n",
    "    sns.histplot(wine_data[column], kde=True)\n",
    "    plt.title(f'Distribution of {column}')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check for non-normality and apply transformations\n",
    "non_normal_features = [col for col in wine_data.columns if not norm.fit(wine_data[col])[1] < 0.05]\n",
    "print(\"Non-normal features:\", non_normal_features)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply log transformation\n",
    "wine_data[non_normal_features] = wine_data[non_normal_features].apply(lambda x: np.log1p(x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- Features exhibiting non-normality can be transformed using methods such as logarithmic transformations to achieve a more normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code for PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standardize the data\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "wine_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(wine_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform PCA\n",
    "pca = PCA()\n",
    "pca.fit(wine_data_scaled)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explained variance\n",
    "explained_variance = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)\n",
    "n_components = np.where(explained_variance >= 0.90)[0][0] + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance: {n_components}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- PCA reduces the number of features while retaining most of the variance in the data. The number of principal components needed to explain 90% of the variance is identified from the cumulative explained variance plot.\n",
