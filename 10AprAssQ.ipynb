    "### Q1: Probability of Being a Smoker Given Health Insurance Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that an employee is a smoker given that they use the company's health insurance plan, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\): Probability that an employee uses the health insurance plan.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\): Probability that an employee is a smoker given that they use the health insurance plan.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\): Probability that an employee is a smoker.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the problem:\n",
    "- \\( P(A) = 0.70 \\) (70% of employees use the health insurance plan)\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) = 0.40 \\) (40% of employees who use the plan are smokers)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are asked to find \\( P(B|A) \\), which is already provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The probability that an employee is a smoker given that they use the health insurance plan is \\( P(B|A) = 0.40 \\) or 40%.\n",

    "### Q2: Difference Between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "  - Assumes that features are binary (i.e., each feature is either present or not present).\n",
    "  - Typically used for binary/boolean features where the feature value is either 0 or 1.\n",
    "  - Example: Document classification where the presence or absence of certain words is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "  - Assumes that features follow a multinomial distribution (i.e., the feature values are counts or frequencies).\n",
    "  - Used for count-based features, like word counts in text classification.\n",
    "  - Example: Document classification where the frequency of words is used to determine the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: How Does Bernoulli Naive Bayes Handle Missing Values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes does not inherently handle missing values. Missing values can be addressed by:\n",
    "- **Imputation**: Filling in missing values with a default value (e.g., the mean, median, or mode) or using a more advanced imputation method.\n",
    "- **Dropping**: Removing instances with missing values from the dataset.\n",
    "- **Binary Encoding**: Treating missing values as a separate category (if it makes sense in the context).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Can Gaussian Naive Bayes Be Used for Multi-Class Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification. It models the features assuming they follow a Gaussian distribution and can handle multiple classes by computing the likelihood of the features for each class and selecting the class with the highest posterior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Access the Spambase Data Set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Preprocess the Data**:\n",
    "   - Handle any missing values and normalize or scale the features if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement Naive Bayes Classifiers**:\n",
    "\n",

    "   column_names = [...]  # Define appropriate column names\n",
    "   data = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=column_names)\n",

    "   # Split the dataset\n",
    "   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",

    "   # Evaluate classifiers\n",
    "   results = {}\n",
    "   for name, clf in classifiers.items():\n",
    "       clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "       y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n",
    "       results[name] = {\n",
    "           'Accuracy': accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred),\n",
    "           'Precision': precision_score(y_test, y_pred),\n",

    "\n",
    "   The `results` dictionary will contain the performance metrics for each classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score) for each classifier.\n",
    "- Discuss why one classifier might perform better than the others based on the nature of the data.\n",
    "- Address any limitations of Naive Bayes, such as assumptions of feature independence or how well it handles noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize which Naive Bayes variant performed best and why.\n",
    "- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier.\n",
    "- Suggest future work, such as experimenting with different preprocessing techniques or exploring other classification algorithms.\n",
